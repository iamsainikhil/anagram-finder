# AnagramFinder

This project is developed to find anagrams for a given string in different levels.

## Basic

The app takes a string from an input on the screen and dynamically displays a gibberish anagram of that string every time a new letter or symbol is added, along with a button to change the current anagram (a kind of re-roll), using Angular's famous 2-way data binding.

## Advanced

The app will display 10 possible anagrams in a table, and have a feature to favorite some anagrams to not be lost when changing the anagrams (i.e. rerolling).

## Master

The app will display the results show on a table that can be sorted alphabetically with one click and filtered by given filter strings.

## Impossible

The app will figure out whether a given string has any viable anagrams using viable anagrams dictionary lookup. 

For dictionary of viable anagram words, please visit `src/assets/anagrams.txt`
